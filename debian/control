Description: Extensible Open Source CAx program (beta)
 FreeCAD is a general purpose feature-based, parametric 3D modeler for CAD, MCAD,
 CAx, CAE and PLM, aimed directly at mechanical engineering and product design but
 also fits a wider range of uses in engineering, such as architecture or other engineering
 specialties. It is 100% Open Source (LGPL2+ license) and extremely modular, allowing
 for very advanced extension and customization.
 .
 FreeCAD is based on OpenCasCade, a powerful geometry kernel, features an Open Inventor-compliant
 3D scene representation model provided by the Coin 3D library, and a broad Python API.
 The interface is built with Qt. FreeCAD runs exactly the same way on Windows, Mac OSX, BSD and
 Linux platforms.

 The documentation is provided in Qt's new help format;
 the new help format version can be viewed in conjunction with the Qt Assistant
 found in the qt4-dev-tools package.
