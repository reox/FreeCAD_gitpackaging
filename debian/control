Description: Extensible Open Source CAx program (beta)
 FreeCAD is a general purpose feature-based, parametric 3D modeler for CAD, MCAD,
 CAx, CAE and PLM, aimed directly at mechanical engineering and product design but
 also fits a wider range of uses in engineering, such as architecture or other engineering
 specialties. It is 100% Open Source (LGPL2+ license) and extremely modular, allowing
 for very advanced extension and customization.
 .
 FreeCAD is based on OpenCasCade, a powerful geometry kernel, features an Open Inventor-compliant
 3D scene representation model provided by the Coin 3D library, and a broad Python API.
 The interface is built with Qt. FreeCAD runs exactly the same way on Windows, Mac OSX, BSD and
 Linux platforms.
